basically im adding the absolute minimum to the executor ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ (inject, a msg box saying "injected", execute, richtextbox).
WHy am I doing this? - well some people dont wanna download Visual Studio just do make a little ahh file, or they don't have enough space for it, ORR you have like 20 mb of free space left.


DEPENDENCIES (i will list things that sound like dependencies and probably are/aren't, so dont be mad at me):
1. 100% needed - .NET Framework 4.8.1 - U don't need the dev pack, just the runtime: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net481
2. idk if needed lmfao - vcredist 2022 (i just recommend to get all because will prob be useful sometime in the future, usually preinstalled on most pcs anyway):
2015 - 2022: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
tomshardware all vcredist (run the batch file it will auto install all of them, 2012 takes a little to install): https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/
