# LightForlorn
Really dumb project because:
1. Took 5 minutes;
2. Anyone can replicate in 1 minute;
3. Not as "lightweight" as I was expecting, dll is 6 mb ðŸ˜­.

DEPENDENCIES:
.Net Framework 4.8.1 - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net481


## if you do legit not know where to download the executor itself, it's at https://github.com/imnotdomasss/LightForlorn/releases/download/v1/LightForlorn.zip
