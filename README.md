# LightForlorn
Really dumb project because:
1. Took 5 minutes;
2. Anyone can replicate in 1 minute;
3. Not as "lightweight" as I was expecting, dll is 6 mb ðŸ˜­.

DEPENDENCIES:
.Net Framework 4.8.1 - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net481


# **if you do legit not know where to download the executor itself, it's at https://github.com/imnotdomasss/LightForlorn/releases/download/v1/LightForlorn.zip **
# **if you do not know which one the source is, it's the .zip, where it says no password, the other one has a password, is a .rar, and im pretty stupid so i have 0 idea on how to remove it.**
