basically im adding the absolute minimum to the executor ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ (inject, a msg box saying "injected", execute, richtextbox).
WHy am I doing this? - well some people dont wanna download Visual Studio just do make a little ahh file, or they don't have enough space for it, ORR you have like 20 mb of free space left.
